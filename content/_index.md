### by Deniz Çivril and Clinton Merck

Do you set a goal of learning R? Has it been ages since you set that goal? You are not alone! It is not easy to start working with a new programming language. It is foreign territory from A-to-Z! Getting started can be a daunting task.

The aim of this tutorial is to give you an excuse to get familiar with some R basics such as Rstudio environment, Rmarkdown, and GitHub while preparing your very own website! If you already know a little, that's perfect. If you don't know anything, give it a try! The tutorial is streamlined – it only covers what you need to know in order to create a website (which is about all that we know ourselves!).

We try to introduce tools as you need them (like GitHub) without getting too caught up in the extensive jargon of R programming. In other words, this tutorial is for newbies to R (like us). However, early/intermediate R users can also find some useful information about modifying their websites. Just follow the lessons and, hopefully, you will be as excited to continue with your R journey as we are!

Please note: We are not teaching data analysis in R. You absolutely need a different tutorial for that. We believe that preparing your website is a nice motive to start playing around with R and RStudio environment.

__Before we start, here are some tips for resolving issues in R (issues can and will arise, but these solutions can often get you back to where you need to be):__ 

When an issue comes up or something’s not right, always restart your R session. It does wonders for solving problems. You can just close and reopen R or use the shortcuts -> cmd + shift + F10 for Mac and ctrl + shift + F10 for Windows.

The Internet is your friend. Ask a search engine about your problem, copy-and-paste warning notes, join forums, etc.
 
Delete the `public` folder and build your website again! This tip will make sense after you learn what the `public` folder is :wink:.
