Deniz decided to prepare this tutorial after she saw [a tweet](https://twitter.com/_ColinFay/status/1148270154830307328?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1148270154830307328&ref_url=http%3A%2F%2F127.0.0.1%3A4321%2Fwww.example.com%2Fstories%2F) by [Colin Fay](https://colinfay.me/) in which he shared [a presentation](https://speakerdeck.com/colinfay/contributing-to-the-r-ecosystem) about how to contribute to the R ecosystem. She persuaded Clinton to join this effort. He reorganized the tutorial from top to bottom and most of the time rewrote it in order to make it better and more understandable for the inspiring R learners.     

We thought it would be nice to encourage others with your website-building stories. Please feel free to send a short story about your motivation to start your R journey, if this tutorial helped you, what the challenges were, etc. Feel free to add a link to your own website! 

The bottom line is that any contribution is a meaningful contribution regardless of your proficiency level. In line with Colin Fay's sentiments and the spirit of the R community, we hope you can use this platform to motivate others!
