When Deniz first asked me to help out with this tutorial, I really had no idea that it was within my reach to create a website with R. My experience with R/RStudio had been limited to standard statistical analyses and data visualizations, and I was not particularly confident in my skills. I happily agreed to review the tutorial, but I was pretty sure that I would struggle to follow along myself.

Once I began, however, I was surprised to learn that website creation did not require the kind of expert-level skillset I had anticipated. With minimal effort and a basic understanding of RStudio, a simple website could be created with ease. With a little more effort, I could learn the tools to customize the website in more complex ways.

I’m incredibly grateful to have been part of this project – if not for this experience, I would never have known that website creating with R was even remotely possible for someone with my skillset. Thank you, Deniz!
