Learning R was on my “have-to-do” list for a while. I installed the program on my computer 4-5 years ago :scream: but failed to motivate myself to study it. To be honest, it was because of my ignorance. I thought that R was another statistical software package and it would be a waste of time. The minute that I heard one could actually prepare a website with R, I decided that I shouldn’t postpone learning it anymore. My first project with R was going to be making my own website!!!

When I googled "R making a website", I ran into Emily Zabor’s [website](http://www.emilyzabor.com/tutorials/rmarkdown_websites_tutorial.html)
(and hence [R-ladies](https://rladies.org/), yay!) and [the blogdown manual](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) by [Yihui Xie](https://yihui.org/), [Amber Thomas](https://amber.rbind.io/) and [Alison Hill](https://alison.rbind.io/). I followed the steps Emily wrote and created a very basic website.

At the beginning, I was not familiar with the R jargon at all. There was Rmarkdown, but there was also markdown? What was the difference? And there were packages that I needed to install. What were they? However, this was not the only problem. I had no idea about a million other things: Github, Git version, Hugo, Jekyll, Netlify… If you are unfamiliar with the R lingo like I was, that’s alright. Just follow along with [the tutorial](/tutorial).   

If you don’t even know the difference between markdown and Rmarkdown, then reading [the blogdown manual](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) can be daunting. I read [Amber Thomas’](https://amber.rbind.io/2016/12/19/website/) and [Alison Hill](https://alison.rbind.io/post/2017-06-12-up-and-running-with-blogdown/)’s blog entries so many times. And each time I read, I learned something new :smiley:. Following the suggestion of the manual, I decided to use [the academic theme](https://themes.gohugo.io/academic/) by [George Cushen](https://georgecushen.com/) for my website. It is not the easiest theme to start with for an R newbie, but its extensive documentation helped a lot later on. Creating the example website was easy. [Dan Quintana](https://www.dsquintana.com/) has a very nice [thread](https://twitter.com/dsquintana/status/993410504570888192) about creating an example website that you can follow.

I really wanted to know what was going on behind the curtain and how to further modify my website. Creating website is one thing, deploying it on the internet is another. It was the first time that I had heard of Git and GitHub and most tutorials introduce them at the beginning of the tutorial, which I found confusing. I was lost! [Peter Baumgarther](https://notes.peter-baumgartner.net/)’s [tutorial](https://notes.peter-baumgartner.net/tutorial/blogdown-tutorial-part-1/) came to my rescue. He introduced these topics later on, which was helpful for me. I also learned a lot from [Happy Git and GitHub for the useR](https://happygitwithr.com/) by [Jenny Bryan](https://jennybryan.org/) and [Jim Hester](https://www.jimhester.com/), and [Git and GitHub instructions from R Packages](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/git.html#git-init) by [Hadley Wickham](http://hadley.nz/). By the way, if you have enough experince with R, Git and GitHub, [Martin Frigaard](https://www.storybench.org/author/martinfri/)’s [tutorial]( https://www.storybench.org/how-to-build-a-website-with-blogdown-in-r/) and [Tyler Clavelle]( https://www.tylerclavelle.com/)’s [tutorial](https://www.tylerclavelle.com/code/2017/blogdown/) are two of my favorites for making websites with R. 

After reading [Colin Fay](https://colinfay.me/)’s [tweet](https://twitter.com/_ColinFay/status/1148270154830307328?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1148270154830307328&ref_url=http%3A%2F%2F127.0.0.1%3A4321%2Fwww.example.com%2Fstories%2F) about how to contribute to the R ecosystem, I decided to write a tutorial about the steps I had followed, but in a way that would benefit those who knew as much (or as little!) as I did when I first set out to create a website with R. I followed [the blogdown manual](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) and [the academic theme document](https://sourcethemes.com/academic/docs/) but I didn’t explain every single option. I just adapted one of the methods they suggested so that it would be relatively easy to follow along. I hope that this tutorial helps you get started and create a website from start to finish.

I would like to thank each and every person I mentioned above for helping me make my own free website. And thanks to everyone who blogs, shares codes, and takes their time to answer questions in the forums. You are the best :punch: :v:. 

And a big thanks to Clinton Merck. This tutorial couldn’t have been completed without him. Clint went over each lesson, pointed out unclear parts, reorganized and rewrote most of the sections. Without his contribution, this tutorial would be more like a bowl of spaghetti. I told him that each lesson would take just 15-20 min but it took much much more than that. Thank you, Clint!

One last piece of advice: Don’t postpone your foray into R website creation, just get started and the rest will follow!
