## Prerequisites :smile: 

- Being able to install a program in your computer
- Being patient and determined

The tutorial benefits from the extensive documentation of [the blogdown package](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) and [the academic theme](https://sourcethemes.com/academic/) but it doesn't explain every single option. It just adapts one of the methods suggested in these documents.
