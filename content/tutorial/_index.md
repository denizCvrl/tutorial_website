## Prerequisites :smile: 

- Being able to install a program in your computer
- Being patient and determined

The tutorial benefits from the extensive documentation of [the blogdown package](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) and [the academic theme](https://sourcethemes.com/academic/) but it doesn't explain every single option. It just adapts one of the methods suggested in these documents.

<span style="color:red">:boom:WARNING:boom::</span> The codes in the snapshots might be slightly different than yours because there are different versions of academic theme. You will probably have the latest version. Follow the instructions in __YOUR__ example code. For example, I might write that you should save the photo under the `static/` folder but the instruction in your code might say to save it under `assets/`.
